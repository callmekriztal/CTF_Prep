#PicoCTF Stegnography Writeup

##Challenge Overview:
This challenge is involved in extracting a flag hidden in a image file.

#STEP 1:
Initial Inspect
  -check its metadate 
'''bash
  file red.png
  exiftool red.png
  strings red.png or strings red.png | less'''
nothing found :-(

##Extract
binwalk -e red.png - extracted directory, indicating that hidden data existed inside the image.

After the Extarction,no readable file was directly visible. Since the flag was within image with colour "red" ,steg sus!
LSB Stegnography technique used using CyberChef (stego tools)

The extracted data was in base64 -> decode -> flag

##FLAG:
  -> picoCTF{r3d_1s_th3_ult1m4t3_cur3_f0r_54dn355_}
